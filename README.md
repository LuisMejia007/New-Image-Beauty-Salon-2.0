# New-Image-Beauty-Salon-2.0
This is a second edition of the New Image Beauty Salon website I published almost 2 years ago. It's been quite a journey since then and I really want to showcase my improvement in coding in HTML5 and CSS, as well as learning JavaScript. Throughout this project I learned a bit more of HTML5 semantics, CSS3 transitions, transforms, and media queries, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript and jQuery. This project was intended as a learning device for myself, to showcase my capabilities in coding in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript as well as my ambition in becoming a Web-Developer.
